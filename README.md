# Bird SQL Command Generator

## What is this?

To deal with scattered data for one of my university assignments, I wrote this Python script super quickly to load all the data in and write commands to load the data into MySQL.

the dataset used here (taxon.csv, vernacular_name.csv) is licensed Public Domain from the IOC World Bird List, hosted at opendata.eol.org:
